# sharp-spawnselect

Hi!

This is my first ever NUI script for FiveM, and I’m very proud how this turned out.

The spawn selector can be used with these resolutions:

1920x1080
2440x1440
3840x2160

If you want to add more resolution supports, please do so.

I have no plans to update this script, but if there’s something scuffed, I’ll fix it.

A personal note to the one who’s gonna use this script:

Please do not remove the copyright, as this is something I’m proud of. I have set the color so low that it isn’t really possible to see the copyright, but please just leave it as it is.

The script is open for anyone who wants to change or do whatever you want to do with it.
